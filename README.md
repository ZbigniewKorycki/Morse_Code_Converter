<h1>Morse Code Converter</h1>

This Python script provides a simple command-line tool to encode and decode text into Morse code. It includes functions for both encryption and decryption of Morse code, as well as an interactive console-based converter for ease of use.

The project was done as part of the course "100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2023" (https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/) - Day 82.
